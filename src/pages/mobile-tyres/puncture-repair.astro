    <p>Don't let a flat tyre leave you stranded on the side of the road. At <strong>Freeway Mobile Tyres</strong>, we offer a fast and reliable emergency mobile tyre repair service in <strong>Poole and Bournemouth</strong> that can have you back on the road in no time.</p>
<p>Most cars don't come with spare wheels, leaving you in a difficult situation when a tyre goes flat. Our mobile tyre puncture repair service is the ideal solution for those who need a quick and effective repair without having to drive to a garage.</p>
<h2>Our Tyre Repair Process</h2>
<p>Our experienced technicians follow a thorough process to ensure your tyre is repaired safely and effectively:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Inspection:</strong> We start by inspecting the tyre to make sure the puncture is in a repairable position and that the hole is no more than 6mm in diameter. We also check the sidewall for damage, which can make the tyre unrepairable.</li>
  <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> If the puncture is repairable and the sidewall is intact, we remove the tyre and prepare it for repair. We drill out the puncture area with a 6mm carbide bit to pull the repair stem through later on. Then, we buff down the surrounding area inside the tyre until it's smooth.</li>
  <li><strong>Repair:</strong> Next, we apply fast-acting vulcanising glue to the site and wait for it to dry. After a minute or so, we pull the repair stem through the hole and stitch down the patch to ensure it remains in place. At this stage, we also replace the removed rubber with an inner liner sealer.</li>
  <li><strong>Finishing:</strong> To finish off, we replace the rubber valve and clean up the rim before reinstalling the repaired tyre. We also check the tyre pressure and torque the wheel nuts to the manufacturer's specification.</li>
</ol>
