    <h2>What Is A Locking Wheel Nut?</h2>
    <p>Locking wheel nuts are specially designed fasteners used to prevent wheel theft. To remove them, you need a specific key that matches the same pattern as the fastener. Without the key, the wheel nut is much harder to remove.</p>
    <p>However, these days, wheel theft is not a prevalent as it once was, so locking wheel nuts tend to cause more hassle than they prevent. We regularly contend with locking wheel nuts overtightened and rounded by a garage or remove a security bolt after the key has gone missing.</p>

    <h2>How Do You Remove Locking Wheel Nuts?</h2>
    <p>We don’t just have one way of removing stubborn locking wheel nuts. We use different tools for different situations; for example, we would use a separate tool for an overtightened nut versus a stripped wheel bolt.</p>
    <p>However, because we remove lockers regularly, we have a selection of master kits and universal removal tools that allow us to get the job done consistently.</p>
    <p>We are recommended to customers by national breakdown companies such as the RAC and AA because of our ability to remove the toughest of locking wheel nuts.</p>
